SQL > SQL JOIN > Left Outer Join
In an left outer join, all rows from the first table mentioned in the SQL query is selected, regardless whether there is a matching row on the second table mentioned in the SQL query. Let's assume that we have the following two tables,

Table Store_Information
Store_Name	Sales	Txn_Date
Los Angeles	1500	Jan-05-1999
San Diego	250	Jan-07-1999
Los Angeles	300	Jan-08-1999
Boston	700	Jan-08-1999
Table Geography

Region_Name	Store_Name
East	Boston
East	New York
West	Los Angeles
West	San Diego
We want to find out sales by store, and we want to see the results for all stores regardless whether there is a sale in the Store_Information table. To do this, we can use the following SQL statement using LEFT OUTER JOIN:
